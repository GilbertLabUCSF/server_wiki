## Gilbert Lab Servers:
- Marlowe (Node9): This is a single node on a copmute cluster containing 9 nodes. Our node, Node 9, is available to the gilbert lab for interactive use (ie Jupyter, Rstudio). Keep in mind, jobs can also be submitted to the entire Marlowe cluster
  - Specs: 64 CPU, 1.5 TB RAM, 210 TB hard drive
- Norgay/Tenzing: These are twin servers that are used entirely interactively (no job queue) so make sure to allocate resources appropriately and communicate with other users when you are running resource-heavy jobs. These servers are shared with the Goodarzi lab.
  - Specs: 56 CPUs, 756 GB RAM, 65 TB Hard drive
